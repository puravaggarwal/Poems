    Migrating to the southern hemishpere
    Flocking beside the flock
    Fluttered a lifeless soul
    Possessor of the unknown

    Higher flights
    Inflicted deeper scathes
    Her wings
    they withered in pain
    But what could she have done
    She had to act a sly
    After all she was brought up to fly

    Her parents,quite early,
    had caught her swim
    Scooping in and all around
    the blue liquid
    At her own whim

    Horrified
    they shared the disdain
    Frozen
    they looked at each other and felt lame
    What the Guano!
    twitter-ed the beaks
    Thereafter
    Soaking the water out of the feats

    "Watch the  beautiful world below
    Listen to the winds so hollow
    Move forward and board the first flight
    For yours is the kingdom of space so light"

    She withered,she cried that she was afraid of heights
    Her eyes she said burnt with light so bright
    Why do I have to soar when I can dive
    Why can't I live and not just survive

    Migrating to the southern hemishpere
    Flocking beside the flock
    Stuttured an inaudible voice
    Warrior of the war inside

    Flying over the kokoana-artica
    She saw life in its utmost form
    A moment inside a moment of a moment
    A breath in - a breath out - a breath in - a breath out

    Compressed Ostracized fervent 
    Finally found itself a vent
    Thought and felt
    what it
    Saw and smelt
    Heard the blood go gushing into the vein
    Lived the moments passing by frame by frame by frame by frame
    Tasted life through the blissful ale
    Sang songs by Ms. Nightingale

    And then she took her final stride
    Stroked her wings hard in delight
    Soared herself to the zenith's toe
    and then - and then she just let it go ...
