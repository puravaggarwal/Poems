Standing still on this endless aisle
    An aisle only as far as I can feel
Who knows what it's like from the top
    A maze, a round or just a spot

While I'm alive I am not losing
    Close my eyes and I see me win
Who knows what's real in this wheel
    Me, my victories, my soul or my dreams

Running against the current in the air
    Softness of the sword I feel
Who knows if it's not the mind
    Travelling time or flashing by a reel

In pain I seek indifference
    and in smiles they seem fake
Who knows who we really are
    Solipsists in the Plato's Cave
