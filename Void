Nothing can ever fill a void 
The not-havingness of the devoid
The room that lets water seep through joints
The space that lets sand settle a bit further down each time

The emptiness lurking in the aching hunger
The nullness dancing in the shivering abode
The darkness darkening behind the visionary ill-vision
The silence building inside the inexpressed emotion

The vacuum that a death creates
The change in meaning that the missing letters generate
The deprivation of an uneducated skull
The barenesss of the unploughed earth

The doubts that a failure hits you with
The fears that success brings along
The blankness of an unutilized piece of paper
The bluntness of an unused tool

The loss of the deserving 
The fall of the soaring
The tears of pain
The years of soltitude

The broken promises
The torn beliefs
Life never moves ahead in space
Replacements don't really replace
Alternatives can never be your native
And Substitute will always remain a prostitute

The weight of the weightless void remains
Hidden within the womb of the surrogate
Giving you the strength to rise whenever you falter
But Ready to peek out fresh at the slightest trigger
Pits that life gifts you with
Are here to stay beside you forever
Falling into and stumbling across
They are there to teach you the skill of skipping over
So you don't really have to fill that void
The not-havingness of the devoid
All you need to make sure is that you know
(∪(∀(a,b ∈ U)(∩(a,b)))-∩(∀(a,b ∈ U)(∩(a,b))))  is equivalent to the entire show 
So basically,
The world is all about how you bake
Your own DIFFERENT slice of cake !
