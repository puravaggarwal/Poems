Sparks of my Life
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ?

I always thought something’s wrong with me
Somehow felt it to be a betrayal of the destiny
Stuff that I thought shouldn’t ever have left me
Didn’t really turn out to be
At every stage I thought I had found the it
One that would inspire me to fight with grit
But wooosh! in another moment the T was gone
Leaving behind an I and a conscious forlorn
Days after the demise were grey
Leaving behind an emptiness hard to phrase
The promises it did seem to fade
The hopes it gave came out of the shade
Forward came questions and doubts
Deeper went I striking clouts
My defeaning logic was still shouting at me
What was it meant to be
Wait-
Motion needs an impetus - true ?
What would happen if the push withdrew
Evil forces would pull you back
Trying to bog you down in every aspect
But the momentum that it gave you as a gift
Will make sure it takes you to the next rift
Where a force F greets you fresh
To carry on with the recursive step.
So this was how the plan was laid
It was never meant to be engraved
It was probably God’s own hand
To hold you through marshy land
Or may be it was something sub-conscious
Cooked up by my brain so dubious
I don’t really identify it’s skin
All am aware of is it’s feel
Be it a girl or my country’s mud
or be it someone from my own blood
Be it a movie or a song
or be it the memory of someone forgotten long
The resonance between I and the it remains
Beating inside my heart till it stays
Now is when my it is gone
Leaving behind an I and a conscious forlorn
Standing alone on the same rift
Am waiting desperately for the next it
The it which I acknowledge as “The Spark Of my Life”
The spark that will momentarily shine so damn
One that will make me the flame I am.
