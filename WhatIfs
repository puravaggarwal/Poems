    Yet to finish it - 
    WHAT IF

    What if we have got it all wrong
    What if the obviously nots were the new norms
  
    
    What if TIME was something just in our head
    A name given to the I that just got dead
    The I I was a moment ago
    Might not be the I I think I know
    For-the premise of "a travelling medium"-we have made it dull
    Making our past and future suddenly sound null
    Now look around and experience a world so surreal
    Making your existence in the present so not real
    All we did is challenged TIME
    Which by default was assumed so divine
    What if we have got it all wrong
    What if the obviously nots were the new norms


    What if PROBABILITY be the new God
    Lets see if it deserves that applaud
    Omnipotence - true
    -It inevitably has a say in whatever you do
    Omniscient - yes
    -It knows it all - no guess !
    Omnipresent - tick
    -Yes ! there with you even when you hide to lick
    It is
    the wish in your hope
    the hope in your faith
    and also the faith in same wish you hoped for

    Plain facts that don't seem would ever alter
    A belief that would make an atheist falter
    Then shouldn't CHANCE be the new almighty 
    and Dice be its brand new deity
    Now imagine a world where you can see this occur
    People chanting dice(y) hyms before after and all around supper
    All we did is went through an introspection
    Which PROBABLY was enough to change our lifelong perception
    What if we have got it all wrong
    What if the obviously nots were the new norms

    ****Incomplete
      
    What if we start enjoying PAIN
    Would that give this world a different name
    For the world would surely go upside down
    The rich and the poor will have to swap their noun
    While Falling down to stiches should rise to riches
    The p's of pain would conquer the L's Of LaughterS
    Foes and friends
    Now dive into and the suffer the pain
    Doesn't Life now seem such an easy game?
    For if one could enjoy every tear
    What probably should be there to fear
    When one ...
    **********************

        
    What if the choice of hell/heaven is what we have here on earth
    and Beyond Death,what we fear most,is actually our Birth
    What if what we call Life be a maze
    The one ahead be the one behind in the circular space
    What if the perceived happiness in this maze just a recursive step
    A wish to able to wish for a new wish at every bisect
    What if we have got it all wrong
    What if the obviously nots were the new norms
